# Electronic Trombone
This is an attempt to make an electronic trombone. Currently, I am on the fourth iteration. I am not sure when I will create a physical model (hopeully sometime in august if I can make some time in the NYU Makerspace). I haven't done an update in about a year, but I hoping to get something working finally.

## Code
It is very easy, and uses buttons to change partials. Depending on the iteration, either a rotational potentiometer or time of flight sensor is used for distance. A pressure sensor captures breath changes.

## Iteration 1
This was a proof of concept where I used a time of flight sensor to read the distance levels of the slide in an attempt to keep slide movement free. However, it was not accurate enough (it was fast however). Videos under "./v1/E-bone".

## Iteration 2
This was a fully mechanical solution where I used 3D printed parts to create a gearing mechanism with a constant force spring and rotational potentiometer. However, it broke as it was under too much tension. Models under "./v2/E-bone2".

## Iteration 3
Now, I am trying to build a different gearbox with partially 3D printed parts and metal parts. This is also following a different design which should put less strain on the parts. Models under "./v3/E-bone3"
Update June 12, 2021: This did not work as planned, it was too complicated, and did not end up being a viable solution. This was ultimately due to not using mechanical advantage. Instead there was undue stress on many of the pieces and the build ended up failing.

## Iteration 4
I am hoping this is the first actual working iteration of the electronic trombone, and around the model that I will end up sticking with. This time I have a direct connection from the string to constant force spring. It is also a much more compact solution, and one that I think will actually be able to work in my favor instead of a hodgepodge of random elements thrown together. This iteration is a lot more robust and simplistic than the previous couple.
