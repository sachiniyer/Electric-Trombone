# Electronic Trombone
This is an attempt to make an electronic trombone. Currently, I am on the third iteration. It is very messy right now, I will clean it up when I finish the final interation.

## Code
It is very easy, and uses buttons to change partials. Depending on the iteration, either a rotational potentiometer or time of flight sensor is used for distance. A pressure sensor captures breath changes.

## Iteration 1
This was a proof of concept where I used a time of flight sensor to read the distance levels of the slide in an attempt to keep slide movement free. However, it was not accurate enough (it was fast however). Videos under "./v1/E-bone".

## Iteration 2
This was a fully mechanical solution where I used 3D printed parts to create a gearing mechanism with a constant force spring and rotational potentiometer. However, it broke as it was under too much tension. Models under "./v2/E-bone2".

## Iteration 3
Now, I am trying to build a different gearbox with partially 3D printed parts and metal parts. This is also following a different design which should put less strain on the parts. Models under "./v3/E-bone3"
