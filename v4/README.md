# Big Realization
I was trying to make the constant force spring with a bunch of 3d printed parts, a lot of which were failing. I however realized that I could just use a 3 foot badge reel connected to a rotational potentiometer to create a much simpler string pot.

This is instead going to be the new model for detecting linear distance, one that I should have done at the start of the project. I would also have bought a string potentiometer, which would have been a much more plug and play solution, but for some reason, they cost like $200.

I was inspired to do this when I saw a string pot in the nyu robotics lab and was just absolutely dumbfounded at how amazing it looked.
